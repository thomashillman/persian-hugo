What is Cyber Security? It's a frequently asked question. One with a million answers. But it really all boils down to one thing. Risk. It's about understanding what your business will accept, what you can mitigate, what you might want to avoid, and what risk you can transfer.

You might think it's fast, sexy, and technical. Funnily enough, it's actually the simple stuff which is the most impactful. We're talking about knowing what you've got and who has access to it. Keeping your infrastructure patched and not having any passwords set along the lines of password123. Multi-factor authentication, it's also a godsend. Keeping control of your network. The basics pay dividends.

Cyber Security is about having backups, a well rehearsed business continuity plan and a disaster recovery plan; just in case the proverbial does hit the fan.

But most importantly, Cyber Security is about people. It's about bringing your stakeholders with you, not just rehashing tired IT tropes of saying no, but actually finding secure alternatives for them.

And yes, sometimes a business won't take your recommendations, but at the end of the day, Information Security is there to enable business. If you're constantly running interference for the sake of it aren't you just doing an attackers work for them?
